/*
 * The current model of modules is that they are basically binary blobs, but
 * can be used for different purposes. They are currently Multiboot2 specific.
 * Currently, the module just gets inserted into a list, which later subsystems
 * can traverse to find modules they care about. 
 *
 * This will eventually turn into a callback-oriented interface (think,
 * pci_probe). 
 *
 * There are initially only two types of modules, a symbol table (much like
 * System.map in Linux) and an ELF module, which is a PIC-compiled shared
 * object which will be run as a program.
