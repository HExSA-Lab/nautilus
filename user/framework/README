Nautilus can load and execute "user" programs.  These run as
components of the kernel itself.  At this point, they have only a
minimal interface to the kernel symbols, exposed by a function
dispatch table.  Think of a cross between a Linux kernel module and a
DOS COM file.

To build your own "user" program, clone this framework directory and
then extend the code in main.c.  Note that it is important that the
code in framework.c, framework.lds, and compilation/linking process
reflected in the Makefile should not be changed.

Within Nautilus, to load/execute/unload:

struct nk_exec *e = nk_load_exec(path);
if (e) { 
   void *inarg;
   void *outarg;
   if (nk_start_exec(e,inarg,&outarg)) {
      // error
   } else {
     // result is return from main func of exec
   }
   nk_unload_exec(e);  // will also free this
}

Currently, there is no complete elf loader in Nautilus.   
"User" programs are ELF executibles conforming to the multiboot2
specification with our "MB64" extensions for HRTs.   The executable
must have the multiboot2 header, it must indicate MB64, and
it must have the relocatable and HRT_EXE flags set.  

The code is built similarly to a dark shadow capsule, except
that stack and heap are managed by Nautilus.   The code must
be statically linked and position independent.
